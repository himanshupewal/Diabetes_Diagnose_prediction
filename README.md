## About
This project is aimed at developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on certain features and historical health data. The model is built using [https://github.com/himanshupewal/Diabetes_Predection_model/tree/f869ffa5b2b5e0e34bd2ccfe3941ff76c5762a96/Notebook] and trained on the [https://github.com/himanshupewal/Diabetes_Predection_model/blob/f869ffa5b2b5e0e34bd2ccfe3941ff76c5762a96/Dataset/diabetes.csv]. The goal of this project is to provide a tool for healthcare professionals and individuals to assess the risk of diabetes.

4. pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Data 

     Description:
  
  ### Data Source: The Pima Indians Diabetes Database is a publicly available dataset often used for diabetes prediction and classification tasks. It originates from a study conducted on the Pima Indian population in Arizona, 
  USA.
  
  ### Size: The dataset typically consists of approximately 768 instances (patient records) with 8 numerical feature variables and 1 binary target variable (0 or 1), where 0 represents non-diabetic and 1 represents diabetic.
  
  ### Features:
  
  1. Number of Pregnancies: The number of times the patient has been pregnant.
  2. Glucose Level: Plasma glucose concentration (in mg/dL) 2 hours after a glucose tolerance test.
  3. Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (in mm Hg).
  4. Skin Thickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (in mm).
  5. Insulin Level: 2-Hour serum insulin (in mu U/ml).
  6. BMI (Body Mass Index): Body mass index, calculated as weight in kg / (height in m)^2.
  7. Diabetes Pedigree Function: A function that measures diabetes hereditary risk.
  8. Age: Age of the patient in years.
  9. 
  ###  Target Variable:
  
  #### Outcome: 
   Binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether or not the patient has diabetes.
   0: No diabetes
   1: Diabetes
   
  ### Use Cases:
  This dataset is commonly used for building machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes based on a patient's health-related features. It's used for classification tasks to create models that can identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes.
  
  ### Data Quality:
  Datasets like this one may require preprocessing steps to handle missing values or outliers, which are common in real-world medical datasets.
  
  ### References: 
  The dataset can often be found in machine learning libraries, repositories, or medical research databases. It's commonly used in tutorials, educational materials, and data science projects to demonstrate classification techniques and predictive modeling.
